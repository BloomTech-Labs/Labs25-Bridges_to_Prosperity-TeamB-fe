# Component Tree Architecture
- For components we have established a pattern for you to use throughout your application. Your components should follow an Atomic structural pattern. Each directory should consist of a single feature. That **does NOT** mean that you need to have a single file per component. You can have as many files as you'd like in a component directory. **It DOES** mean that you should organize all the pieces of your component into an `index.js` file and export out that single component to be used throughout your app.
